1. I create one repository of DriverDistance contains all DriverDistanceIml to return report details for rank based on a total distance
2. I create two classes:
	DriverDistanceIml implements DriverDistance
	ErrorMessage for throw error where there are no available drivers or customer and restaurant has a different city
3. In WaltServiceImpl class I create some functions - above every function, there is an explanation
4. For the rank's reports I create a text file in the root project directory with the desire details
